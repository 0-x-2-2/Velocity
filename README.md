# Velocity

Velocity is a next-generation Minecraft: Java Edition proxy suite. It is
designed specifically with mass-scale Minecraft in mind.

## Goals

* Simple, easy to understand codebase.
* High performance: handle thousands of players on one proxy.
* Flexible API built for mass-scale Minecraft.
* Licensed under the MIT license.
* First-class support for Paper, Sponge, and Forge. (Other implementations
  may work, but we make every endeavor to support these server implementations
  specifically.)

## Status

Velocity is far from finished. It's currently enough to act as an MITM
proxy for a Minecraft server even though that's not the goal. You should
join us on **irc.spi.gt** `#velocity` or send us a pull request.
