# Velocity

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/jenkins/s/https/ci.velocitypowered.com/job/velocity/job/master.svg)](https://ci.velocitypowered.com/job/velocity/job/master/)

Velocity is a next-generation Minecraft: Java Edition proxy suite. It is
designed specifically with mass-scale Minecraft in mind.

## Goals

* Simple, easy to understand codebase.
* High performance: handle thousands of players on one proxy.
* Flexible API built for mass-scale Minecraft.
* Licensed under the MIT license.
* First-class support for Paper, Sponge, and Forge. (Other implementations
  may work, but we make every endeavor to support these server implementations
  specifically.)

## Status

Velocity is far from finished, but most of the essential pieces are in place:
you can switch between two servers running Minecraft 1.9-1.13. More versions
and functionality is planned.

You should join us on **irc.spi.gt** `#velocity` or send us a pull request.
